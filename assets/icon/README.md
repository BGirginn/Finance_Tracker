# Icon Assets

Place your app icon here:

- `icon.png` - Main app icon (1024x1024 recommended)

The icon will be automatically processed by `flutter_launcher_icons` to generate all required sizes for Android.

If you don't have an icon yet, the app will use Flutter's default icon on first build.

## Quick Setup

1. Create or download a 1024x1024 PNG icon
2. Save it as `assets/icon/icon.png`
3. Run: `flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main`

Or just build the app - icons will be generated automatically if the file exists!
